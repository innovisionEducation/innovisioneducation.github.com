  <p class="lead">Learning how to program is difficult and can be extremely frustrating. Anyone new to programming has to learn two concepts at the same time: how to analyse problems and how write source code.</p>
  <p class="lead">School Of Programming ASD takes a unique approach to teaching people with ASD how to program. We are able to teach people how to program without teaching them a programming language using a visual object language.</p>
  <p class="lead">This allows us to have better control of the learning environment limiting any frustration that may come from the difficult task of learning how to code. Our students are able to focus on analysing and solving problems.</p>
