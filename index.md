	<p class="lead">School of Programming Neuro (SOP Neuro) is an environment that allows a student to learn to write software programs using visual tools. The student drags software parts from a toolbox, arranges the parts on a canvas, and connects the parts to direct the flow of activity through assembly.</p>

	<p class="lead">By assembling parts, the student learns how to break complex tasks into logical units, a critical component of problem-solving.</p>
